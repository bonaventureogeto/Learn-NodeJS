In the example above, the readFile function reads the contents of file.txt. 
When the file is read, the callback function is executed. 
If an error occurs during the operation, the error is passed to the callback function as the first argument.

Promises
Promises provide a cleaner way of handling asynchronous code in Node.js. 
Promises represent a value that may not be available yet and allow you to chain
 multiple asynchronous operations together.
